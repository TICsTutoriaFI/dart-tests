# Palindrome

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward.

In this exercise you will make a method that takes a string and verify if it's a valid palindrome.

## Instructions

Inside the `isPalindrome` function you will receive a string. Write a code that checks if the given string is a palindrome given the following conditions:

- The string is case-insensitive: It's the same `BeaR`, `bear` and `BEAR`
- The string could contain spaces: `taco cat` is a palindrome
